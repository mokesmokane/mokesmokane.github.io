      <itunes:subtitle>A Conversation with Will Storr</itunes:subtitle>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the first 40 minutes of this episode are available on the paywalled podcast version (the black podcast logo). If you&rsquo;d like to hear the full 1 hour 25 minutes of this episode and gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast, you&rsquo;ll need to SUBSCRIBE <a href="https://www.samharris.org/subscribe">here</a>. If you&rsquo;re already subscribed and on the private RSS feed, the podcast logo should appear red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Harris speaks with Will Storr about the role that status plays in human life and culture. They talk about the taboo around caring about status, egalitarianism, the perpetual insecurity of status, how we play multiple status games simultaneously, identity, social connection, dominance, virtue, success, status as an evolved mechanism, gossip, status and health, the consequences of humiliation, the role of social media, status and politics, conspiracy thinking, moral panics, status and philanthropy, and other topics.</span></p>
<p><strong>Will Storr</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an award-winning writer. He's the author of six critically acclaimed books, including the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunday Times</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bestseller </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3e3xAop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Science of Storytelling</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

      <title>Best Of: This Is Your Brain on Deep Reading. It’s Pretty Magnificent.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Every day, we consume a mind-boggling amount of information. We scan online news articles, sift through text messages and emails, scroll through our social-media feeds — and that’s usually before we even get out of bed in the morning. In 2009, a team of researchers found that the average American consumed about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/technology/10data.html">34 gigabytes</a> of information a day. Undoubtedly, that number would be even higher today.</p><p>But what are we actually getting from this huge influx of information? How is it affecting our memories, our attention spans, our ability to think? What might this mean for today’s children, and future generations? And what does it take to read — and think — deeply in a world so flooded with constant input?</p><p>Maryanne Wolf is a researcher and scholar at U.C.L.A.’s School of Education and Information Studies. Her books “<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/proust-and-the-squid-maryanne-wolf">Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain</a>” and “<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/reader-come-home-maryanne-wolf?variant=32128334594082">Reader, Come Home: The Reading Brain in a Digital World</a>” explore the relationship between the process of reading and the neuroscience of the brain. And, in Wolf’s view, our era of information overload represents a historical inflection point where our ability to read — truly, deeply read, not just scan or scroll — hangs in the balance.</p><p>In this conversation, recorded in November 2022, we discuss why reading is a fundamentally “unnatural” act, how scanning and scrolling differ from “deep reading,” why it’s not accurate to say that “reading” is just one thing, how our brains process information differently when we’re reading on a Kindle or a laptop as opposed to a physical book, how exposure to such an abundance of information is rewiring our brains and reshaping our society, how to rediscover the lost art of reading books deeply, what Wolf recommends to those of us who struggle against digital distractions, what parents can do to to protect their children’s attention, how Wolf’s theory of a “biliterate brain” may save our species’ ability to deeply process language and information and more.</p><p>We’ll be back on Friday, Dec. 1, with a new episode.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312278496/theglassbeadgame" target="_blank">The Glass Bead Game (Magister Ludi)</a> by Hermann Hesse</p><p><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-we-read-now-9780190084097?cc=us&lang=en&" target="_blank">How We Read Now</a> by Naomi S.
